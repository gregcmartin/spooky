## Features

- Multi-threaded scanning for high performance
- Support for scanning Majestic Million top sites
- Configurable percentage-based scanning
- Category-based secret detection
- Detailed statistics and reporting
- Cross-platform support

## Secret Categories

Spooky can detect secrets from various categories:
- AWS (Access Keys, Secret Keys)
- API Keys (Generic API Keys, Bearer Tokens)
- Cloud Services (Firebase, GCM, Google, Azure)
